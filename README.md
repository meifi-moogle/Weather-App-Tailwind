# Weather-App-Tailwind
Using an API (https://www.weatherapi.com/ ) to make a responsive Weather App with Tailwind CSS!

This is actually my second version of it. The first one was made using HTML / CSS / JS and I decided to make a more intuitive version while learning Tailwind CSS as well ! 

Building this, I got to learn how to read and use API data, use local storage to save user preferences as well as handling and displaying error messages. 
The app also takes local time in consideration to properly display weather estimations for the next few hours !
